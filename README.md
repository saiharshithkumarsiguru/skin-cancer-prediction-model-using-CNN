Skin cancer prediction if done early can save a lot of lives,this model is a cost efficient model and this is built on CNN.This model may be used in my future projects  

files:
1) skin-cancer-prediction-model-using-CNN.ipynb : This  is esentially our main file that we will be using to detect skin cancer . 
2) data :This is the folder that contains dataset.
	It has two  folders test,train
	In train we have 2637 benign and malignant images
	In test we have 600 benign and malignant images

Interaction with the project :
 Just run the skin-cancer-prediction-model-using-CNN.ipynb, everything runs smooth if you have installed all the essential libraries.


This model didn't overfit and gave an accuracy above 78 on both test and train data.
